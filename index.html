					<h2 id="blackTitle">Buenos Aires, Argentina</h2>
						<p class="brown-paragraph">My first trip abroad after earning my undergraduate degree in history from KU was to Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was fresh out of school and the first job I found in Kansas City was as a traveling pet food salesman for Blue Buffalo. The walls were clearly closing in, so after a few months of that, I strapped every dime I had to my groin and flew to South America on a tourist visa. I spent a total of two years in the Argentine capital, working odd jobs, and taking meandering trips to Patagonia and wandering the country&apos;s deserts and jungles to the north. I ended up dating a local, which helped out tremendously with the bills and streamlined my acquisition of the local dialect of Spanish.  Every three months I had to cross the boarder into Chile, Uruguay or Brazil to renew my visa or risk getting deported.</p>

					<h2>Recife, Brazil</h2>
						<p>I met one of my best friends, a Polish national from Dublin, while living in an apartment on Avenida Belgrano in Buenos Aires. I was super depressed when he split for northeastern Brazil, so I followed him there. It took me over a week to get from Buenos Aires to Recife by bus, and once I got there my friend immediately got me a job as the front desk guy at a hostel in Boa Viagem working for food and lodging. I spent three solid months in Recife, meeting people from all over the world, and even got to attend Carnival, an annual Brazilian festival characterized by days of drunken revelry. I eventually had to leave Brazil once my visa expired, so I went back to Buenos Aires before eventually going home to the US.</p>

					<h2>Dublin, Ireland</h2>
						<p>About a year of being home in the US, I caught the travel bug once again and set off for Dublin, Ireland where I spent a month sleeping on my friend&apos;s couch (the same friend I met in Buenos Aires). The house was occupied by two Poles, three Spaniards, and one Irish guy who was never there. Aside from my friend and the Irish guy, nobody else spoke English very well. One time the power went out, and nobody could figure out whose name the house was actually registered under, and nobody could understand what the power company people were saying. So, my new housemates put me on the phone to deal with such issues. Unfortunately, I did very little in Dublin. I spent most of my time at the house in Santry, a suburb by the airport, huddled by the fire drinking homemade Polish vodka to keep warm because it was so bone chillingly cold the whole time I was there.</p>

					<h2>Lisbon, Portugal</h2>
						<p>Before flying to Dublin, I stopped in Lisbon, Portugal for a week to meet up with a couple of old friends. Lisbon is absolutely wonderful and I&apos;d recommend it to everyone. I&apos;d say the highlight was visiting Sintra, a tourist destination and municipality northwest from Lisbon known for its many ancient castles.</p>

					<h2>Colombia</h2>
						<p>On my way home from Argentina, I was fortunate to stop over in Colombia for jaunt back and forth along the Caribbean coast. I started off in the old port city of Cartagena, and moved east to Barranquilla, and then Santa Marta before looping back to Cartagena to catch a flight to Miami. I&apos;d say the highlight was visiting the Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona as well as a small, sleepy beach town called Palomino. The only way to get from the bus station in Palomino to the beach where all the lodging is located is by moto taxi (basically adolescent children on dirt bikes). Riding on the back of a dirt bike with my giant backpack at what seemed to me at the time as breakneck speed, was absolutely terrifying to me, and I never want to do it again. At one point the kid operating the bike had to tell me not to grab on so hard, but I was too seized with fear to let go.</p>

I had ordered food from a food truck and there was a piece of metal inside. I almost swallowed the piece of metal and most likely would have had to be rushed to the hospital if I did. Luckily I bit into it and caught it.

					<h2>Reykjavik, Iceland</h2>
						<p>After all of my travels were over and I had started grad school at MU, I really wanted to keep traveling, but I couldn&apos;t afford it anymore, and didn&apos;t have the time. But, when I saw a reasonably priced round-trip ticket from St. Louis to Reykjavik, Iceland, I simply couldn&apos;t resist. Besides, I had a grad school friend who had moved to Reykjavik the year before and had an apartment in the city center. There was no way I wasn&apos;t going to take advantage of this series of events, so I skipped a couple days of class and flew to Iceland. While Iceland is a gorgeous country with wonderful people, it is probably the most expensive place in the universe and if you go there you will cry every time you have to pay for anything. Fortunately I had stocked up on beer and Brenniv&iacute;n (Icelandic schnapps, the country&apos;s signature distilled beverage according to Wikipedia) at Duty Free before loading up and speeding off in the rented Hyundai sedan my friend picked me up in.</p>
